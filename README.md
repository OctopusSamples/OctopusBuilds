# Octopus Builds
The Octopus Builds video series focuses on the Trident Project for the ficitional company Octo Pet Shop.  The video series assumes you are taking on the role of a DevOps engineer assigned to help the Trident development team.  The Trident project and team are brand new to the company and have never used Octopus Deploy.

Throughout the video series various variables, scripts and packages will be used.  Attempting to create those from scratch (or by simply watching a video) can be error prone.  This repository contains all those resources, so if you are following along you can leverage them.

# Resources

The resources provided in this repository are:

- Packages: zip files you can upload and use in your instance.
- Screenshots: if the video uses a visual aide outside of Octopus Deploy it will be included here.
- Scripts: Any scripts created for a specific episode can be found here.
- Variables: Any variables added to the project, including their values.
